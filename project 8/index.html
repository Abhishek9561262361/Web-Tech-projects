              Varanasi is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
              dating to the 11th century B.C. Regarded as the spiritual capital
              of India, the city draws Hindu pilgrims who bathe in the Ganges
              River’s sacred waters and perform funeral rites. Along the city's
              winding streets are some 2,000 temples, including Kashi
              Vishwanath, the “Golden Temple,” dedicated to the Hindu god
              Shiva.The city has long been an educational and musical centre:
              many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians
              live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the
              Benares gharana form of Hindustani classical music was developed.

              Jaisalmer is a former medieval trading center and a princely state
              in the western Indian state of Rajasthan, in the heart of the Thar
              Desert. Known as the "Golden City," it's distinguished by its
              yellow sandstone architecture. Dominating the skyline is Jaisalmer
              Fort, a sprawling hilltop citadel buttressed by 99 bastions.
              Behind its massive walls stand the ornate Maharaja's Palace and
              intricately carved Jain temples.Tourism is a major industry in
              Jaisalmer. The Government of India initiated departmental
              exploration for oil in 1955–56 in the Jaisalmer area.[13] Oil
              India Limited discovered natural gas in 1988 in the Jaisalmer
              basin.

              The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th
              century in the city of Mumbai, India. It was erected to
              commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first
              British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Ramchandani
              Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk. The foundation stone was
              laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic
              style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati
              architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George
              Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed
              in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is
